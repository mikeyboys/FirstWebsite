    <h1>A Simple Guide to Adding Custom Icons in Your PowerApp</h1>

    <p>One of the easiest ways to make your PowerApp look professional and user-friendly is to move beyond the standard icons. Using custom Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) allows for crisp, modern icons that can be dynamically coloured. Hereâ€™s how to do it using the fantastic free resource, PowerIcons.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Find and Customise Your Icon</h2>
    <p>Navigate to <a href="https://www.powericons.dev/" target="_blank" class="text-purple-600 hover:underline">powericons.dev</a>. This site is built specifically for PowerApps developers and has a great library of icons. Browse or search for an icon that fits your needs. You can customise the stroke width and other properties before you copy the code.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Copy the SVG Code</h2>
    <p>Once you've selected your icon, simply click the "Copy SVG" button. This copies the icon's code to your clipboard. It's a block of text that describes the icon's shape and properties.</p>
    
    <h2>Step 3: Add an Image Control in PowerApps</h2>
    <p>In your PowerApp, insert a new Image control from the "Media" dropdown. Don't worry that it's an image control; PowerApps can render SVG code as an image. Resize it to your desired icon size.</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Paste the SVG Code</h2>
    <p>Select the new Image control. In the properties panel, select the <strong>Image</strong> property from the dropdown. In the formula bar, you need to format the SVG code as a text string that PowerApps can understand. It needs to look like this:</p>
    <p><code>"data:image/svg+xml;utf8, " & EncodeUrl("[PASTE YOUR SVG CODE HERE]")</code></p>
    <p>Replace `[PASTE YOUR SVG CODE HERE]` with the code you copied from PowerIcons. The `EncodeUrl` function ensures that all the special characters in the code are correctly interpreted.</p>

    <p>That's it! You should now see your crisp, custom icon in your app. Because it's an SVG, you can even change its colour dynamically by replacing the `stroke` or `fill` values within the code using Power Fx formulas, making your app's UI even more responsive and intuitive.</p>
